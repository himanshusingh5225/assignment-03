and obtain the factorial of 5 and 6 as 120 and 720 by calling the function.


Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
we Imported the math module for mathematical calculations as 'import math'
Take a user input as 'number' which is float
and uses some key function :
math.sqrt(number) to calculate the square root
math.log(number) to calculate natural logarithm
math.sin(number) to calculate the sine value
